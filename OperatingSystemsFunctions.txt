One function of an Operating System is to provide a user interface. This user interface (UI) is generally a major factor in what sets one OS apart from others. The UI is what users see most of the time when using a computer so it really shapes the experience of the user and helps define the OS for most.
Another function of an Operating System is establishing and internet connection. Most Operating Systems are designed to detect when the devide is connected to a network (hard wired or WiFi) and prompt the user to connect to the network. The OS generally takes care of all the work for enabling the connection, making it a smooth and easy experience for the user.
Yet another function od an Operating System is Automatic Updates. Operating Systems are constantly being updated by the designers. It could be a bug fix, a security risk, or just an optimnization of resources that prompts an update, but there are generally new updates available quite often. Many users don't realize how often their OS is updated or the necessity for the updates to be applied. Many OS's have built in functions that do most of the work behind the scenes so users almost never even realize their system has been updated.
