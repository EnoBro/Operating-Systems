One function of an Operating System is to provide a user interface. This user interface (UI) is generally a major factor in what sets one OS apart from others. The UI is what users see most of the time when using a computer so it really shapes the experience of the user and helps define the OS for most.
Another function of an Operating System is establishing and internet connection. Most Operating Systems are designed to detect when the devide is connected to a network (hard wired or WiFi) and prompt the user to connect to the network. The OS generally takes care of all the work for enabling the connection, making it a smooth and easy experience for the user.
